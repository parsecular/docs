This page is deprecated. Choose one of the three credential strategies:

- **[Managed](/getting-started/managed-wallet)** — Parsec creates and manages wallet + credentials for you.
- **[Self](/getting-started/direct-trader)** — Provide your own exchange credentials, Parsec stores them.
- **[Per-request](/getting-started/per-request-credentials)** — Pass credentials per-request, nothing stored.
