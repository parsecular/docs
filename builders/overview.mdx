## What is the Builder Program?

The Builder Program lets you build prediction market applications on top of
Parsec's unified API. You manage your end-users, route their orders across
every supported exchange, and earn revenue on every transaction through
fee escrow.

**You build the app. We handle the infrastructure.**

## How it works

```
Your App                     Parsec API                   Exchanges
────────                     ──────────                   ──────────
1. Create + onboard    ───►  POST /builder/onboard   ───►  (user + wallet + exchange linked)
2. Route orders        ───►  POST /orders + X-Builder-Customer-Id
3. Collect fees        ───►  Fee escrow (on-chain)   ───►  USDC to your wallet
```

Create a user and onboard to an exchange in a single call:

```bash
POST /builder/onboard
{
  "external_id": "user_001",
  "exchange": "polymarket",
  "mode": "managed"
}
```
