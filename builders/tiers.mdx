## Overview

Builder tiers reward you for the trading volume your application drives through
Parsec. As your monthly volume grows, you unlock larger QPS pools, higher fee
limits, and a greater share of the fees you collect — culminating in majority
ownership at Platinum.

## Tier levels

| Tier | Monthly Volume | Builder Share | Parsec Share | Max Fee BPS | QPS Pool | Support |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Bronze** | < $500K | 10% | 90% | 50 bps (0.5%) | 500 | Discord |
| **Silver** | $500K - $5M | 40% | 60% | 100 bps (1.0%) | 2,000 | Discord + priority |
| **Gold** | $5M - $10M | 50% | 50% | 200 bps (2.0%) | 10,000 | Dedicated Slack |
| **Platinum** | $10M+ | 60% | 40% | Custom | Custom | Dedicated engineer |

<Info>
All builders start at **Bronze**. Tier upgrades are evaluated monthly and
applied automatically. Downgrades have a 1-month grace period.

## The jump incentive

The tiers are designed to reward builders who scale aggressively:

```
Bronze (10%)  ──── 4x share increase ────►  Silver (40%)
                    for 10x volume

Silver (40%)  ──── even partnership ──────►  Gold (50%)
                    at 2x volume

Gold (50%)    ──── majority ownership ────►  Platinum (60%)
                    at 2x volume
```

The biggest reward comes from the **Bronze → Silver jump**: growing your volume
10x earns you a 4x increase in revenue share (10% → 40%). This means your
effective revenue grows **40x** when you cross the $500K threshold.

At **Gold**, you and Parsec split fees evenly — a true 50/50 partnership.

At **Platinum**, you become the **majority stakeholder** in the fee split,
taking home 60% of all fees collected.

## How tiers work

### Monthly volume

Your monthly volume is the total notional value of all orders placed via
`POST /orders` with `X-Builder-Customer-Id` across all your end-users. This
includes orders on all supported exchanges.

### Max fee BPS

The maximum `fee_bps` that Parsec admins can configure for your account. Higher
tiers unlock the ability to charge higher fees if your app provides enough value
to justify them.

### QPS pool

Your shared rate limit pool across all end-users. Higher tiers get larger pools
for higher-throughput applications.

### Builder share

The percentage of collected fees sent to your `affiliate_address`. The
remainder goes to the Parsec treasury. Your share increases automatically as
you move up tiers.

## Revenue examples

Assuming 25 bps fee rate and 80% average fill rate:

| Tier | Monthly Volume | Fees Collected | Builder Share | Your Revenue |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Bronze | $500K | $1,250 | 10% | **$100/mo** |
| Silver | $5M | $12,500 | 40% | **$4,000/mo** |
| Gold | $10M | $25,000 | 50% | **$10,000/mo** |
| Platinum | $25M | $62,500 | 60% | **$30,000/mo** |

### Revenue growth at each tier jump

| Transition | Volume Growth | Revenue Growth | Why |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-----|
| Bronze → Silver | 10x | **40x** | 10x volume + 4x share increase |
| Silver → Gold | 2x | **2.5x** | 2x volume + 1.25x share increase |
| Gold → Platinum | 2.5x | **3x** | 2.5x volume + 1.2x share increase |

<Tip>
The Bronze → Silver jump is by far the most rewarding transition. Focus on
getting to $500K/month — your per-dollar earnings jump dramatically.

## Tier upgrades

Tier evaluations happen on the **1st of each month** based on the previous
month's trading volume.

**To check your current stats:**

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
# Check your QPS pool and user count
curl "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/pool" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_YOUR_BUILDER_KEY"

# Check your escrow config (fee BPS + affiliate share)
curl "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/escrow/config" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_YOUR_BUILDER_KEY"
```
```typescript TypeScript
const pool = await parsec.get('/api/v1/builder/pool');
const escrow = await parsec.get('/api/v1/builder/escrow/config');

console.log('Users:', pool.end_user_count);
console.log('QPS:', pool.qps_pool);
console.log('Fee BPS:', escrow.fee_bps);
console.log('Affiliate:', escrow.affiliate_address);
```
```python Python
pool = requests.get(
    "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/pool",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "pk_live_YOUR_BUILDER_KEY"},
).json()

escrow = requests.get(
    "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/escrow/config",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "pk_live_YOUR_BUILDER_KEY"},
).json()

print(f"Users: {pool['end_user_count']}")
print(f"QPS pool: {pool['qps_pool']}")
print(f"Fee BPS: {escrow['fee_bps']}")
```

## Platinum tier

Platinum builders get custom terms negotiated directly with the Parsec team:

- **60%+ affiliate share** — majority of all fee revenue
- Custom fee BPS limits
- Custom QPS pool sizes
- Dedicated engineering support
- Priority feature requests
