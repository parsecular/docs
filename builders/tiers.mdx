## Overview

Builder tiers reward you for the trading volume your application drives through
Parsec. As your monthly volume grows, you unlock larger QPS pools, higher fee
limits, and a greater share of the fees you collect.

## Tier levels

| Tier | Monthly Volume | Builder Share | Parsec Share | Max Fee BPS | QPS Pool | Support |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Iron** | < $100K | 15% | 85% | 50 bps (0.5%) | 500 | Discord |
| **Bronze** | $100K - $1M | 25% | 75% | 75 bps (0.75%) | 1,000 | Discord |
| **Silver** | $1M - $10M | 35% | 65% | 100 bps (1.0%) | 2,500 | Discord + priority |
| **Gold** | $10M - $50M | 40% | 60% | 125 bps (1.25%) | 10,000 | Dedicated Slack |
| **Platinum** | $50M+ | 45% | 55% | 150 bps (1.5%) | Custom | Dedicated engineer |

<Info>
All builders start at **Iron**. Tier upgrades are evaluated monthly and
applied automatically. Downgrades have a 1-month grace period.

## The growth incentive

The tiers are designed to reward builders who scale aggressively:

```
Iron (15%)    ──── 10x share increase ────►  Bronze (25%)
                    at $100K/mo

Bronze (25%)  ──── 10x volume  ───────────►  Silver (35%)
                    at $1M/mo

Silver (35%)  ──── 10x volume  ───────────►  Gold (40%)
                    at $10M/mo

Gold (40%)    ──── 5x volume   ───────────►  Platinum (45%)
                    at $50M/mo
```

The biggest absolute revenue jump comes from crossing the **$1M/month Silver
threshold**: your volume grows 10x while your share increases from 25% to 35%.
At that point, your effective revenue grows **14x** compared to Bronze.

## How tiers work

### Monthly volume

Your monthly volume is the total notional value of all orders placed via
`POST /orders` with `X-Builder-Customer-Id` across all your end-users. This
includes orders on all supported exchanges.

### Max fee BPS

The maximum fee rate you can charge your users. Higher tiers unlock the
ability to charge higher fees if your app provides enough value to justify them.

| Tier | Max Fee | Example on $100 order |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Iron | 50 bps | $0.50 |
| Bronze | 75 bps | $0.75 |
| Silver | 100 bps | $1.00 |
| Gold | 125 bps | $1.25 |
| Platinum | 150 bps | $1.50 |

### QPS pool

Your shared rate limit pool across all end-users. Higher tiers get larger pools
for higher-throughput applications.

### Builder share

The percentage of collected fees sent to your `affiliate_address`. The
remainder goes to the Parsec treasury. Your share increases automatically as
you move up tiers.

## Revenue examples

Assuming 50 bps fee rate and 80% average fill rate:

| Tier | Monthly Volume | Fees Collected | Builder Share | Your Revenue |
|------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Iron | $100K | $500 | 15% | **$60/mo** |
| Bronze | $500K | $2,500 | 25% | **$500/mo** |
| Silver | $5M | $25,000 | 35% | **$7,000/mo** |
| Gold | $25M | $125,000 | 40% | **$40,000/mo** |
| Platinum | $100M | $500,000 | 45% | **$180,000/mo** |

### Revenue growth at each tier jump

| Transition | Volume Growth | Revenue Growth | Why |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-----|
| Iron -> Bronze | 10x | **8.3x** | 10x volume + 1.67x share increase |
| Bronze -> Silver | 10x | **14x** | 10x volume + 1.4x share increase |
| Silver -> Gold | 10x | **5.7x** | 10x volume + 1.14x share increase |
| Gold -> Platinum | 5x | **5.6x** | 5x volume + 1.125x share increase |

<Tip>
The Bronze -> Silver jump is by far the most rewarding transition. Growing
from $100K to $1M/month earns you a 14x increase in revenue.
</Tip>

## Tier upgrades

Tier evaluations happen on the **1st of each month** based on the previous
month's trading volume.

**To check your current stats:**

```bash curl
# Check your QPS pool and user count
curl "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/pool" \

# Check your escrow config
curl "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/escrow/config" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_live_YOUR_BUILDER_KEY"
```
```typescript TypeScript
const pool = await fetch(
  'https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/builder/pool',

const escrow = await fetch(

  { headers: { 'X-API-Key': BUILDER_KEY } },
).then(r => r.json());

console.log('Users:', pool.end_user_count);
console.log('QPS:', pool.qps_pool);
console.log('Fee BPS:', escrow.fee_bps);
```
```python Python

print(f"Users: {pool['end_user_count']}")
print(f"QPS pool: {pool['qps_pool']}")
print(f"Fee BPS: {escrow['fee_bps']}")
