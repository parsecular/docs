description: "This endpoint has been removed. Use POST /onboard instead."
---

<Warning>
`POST /api/v1/wallet` has been removed. Use [`POST /api/v1/onboard`](/api/onboard) with `mode: "managed"` instead.

The onboard endpoint creates a wallet, derives CLOB credentials, and sets token approvals in a single call. It supports both EOA and Safe wallet types via the `wallet_type` parameter.
</Warning>

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/onboard" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "exchange": "polymarket",
    "mode": "managed"
  }'
```

<Info>
`GET /api/v1/wallet` is still available to check wallet state and linked exchanges.
See the [Wallet State endpoint](/api/get-wallet).
</Info>

See the [Onboard endpoint](/api/onboard) for full documentation.
