## 1. Get your Parsec API key

Sign up at [parsecapi.com](https://parsecapi.com) and grab your API key from the **Settings** page.

Your API key works immediately — no exchange credentials needed for market data.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: pk_YOUR_KEY" \
  https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/markets?exchanges=polymarket&limit=3
```

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: pk_YOUR_KEY" \
  https://api.parsecapi.com/api/v1/orderbook?parsec_id=polymarket:YOUR_MARKET_ID
```

<Info>
Markets, orderbooks, price history, and real-time WebSocket streaming all work with just your API key — no exchange accounts required.

## 2. Link your exchanges (for trading)

Connect your exchange credentials once and trade through a single API forever.

Go to **Settings** in your Parsec dashboard and enter the credentials for each exchange you want to trade on.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Polymarket">
    **What you need:** Your EVM wallet private key.

    This is the same private key you'd export from MetaMask, Rabby, or any EVM wallet. Polymarket doesn't have separate API keys — your wallet key is used to sign orders on-chain.

    In your Parsec Settings, paste your key into the **EVM Private Key** field.

    If you use a Gnosis Safe or proxy wallet, also fill in the **Funder Address** field with your Safe address.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Kalshi">
    **What you need:** Kalshi API Key ID + RSA Private Key.

    1. Log in to [kalshi.com](https://kalshi.com) and go to your API settings
    2. Generate a new API key pair — you'll get a **Key ID** and download a **private key file** (`.pem`)
    3. In your Parsec Settings, paste both values into the **Kalshi API Key ID** and **Kalshi Private Key** fields
  </Accordion>

## 3. Start building

Install the SDK and start trading in a few lines of code.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install parsec-api
```
```bash pip
pip install parsec_api
```
</CodeGroup>

**Fetch markets:**

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import ParsecAPI from 'parsec-api';

const client = new ParsecAPI();

const markets = await client.markets.list({ exchanges: ['polymarket'], limit: 5 });
console.log(markets.markets);
```
```python Python
from parsec_api import ParsecAPI

client = ParsecAPI()

markets = client.markets.list(exchanges=["polymarket"], limit=5)
print(markets.markets)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Place an order:**

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const order = await client.orders.create({
  exchange: 'polymarket',
  market_id: '0x...',
  outcome: 'yes',
  side: 'buy',
  price: 0.55,
  size: 100,
});
console.log(order.id, order.status);
```
```python Python
order = client.orders.create(
    exchange="polymarket",
    market_id="0x...",
    outcome="yes",
    side="buy",
    price=0.55,
    size=100,
)
print(order.id, order.status)
```
</CodeGroup>

**Stream real-time orderbooks:**

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const ws = client.ws();

ws.on('orderbook', (book) => {
  console.log(`${book.parsecId}: best bid ${book.bids[0]?.price}`);
});

await ws.connect();
ws.subscribe({ parsecId: 'polymarket:0x...', outcome: 'Yes' });
```
```python Python
import asyncio
from parsec_api import ParsecAPI

client = ParsecAPI()
ws = client.ws()

@ws.on("orderbook")
async def on_book(book):
    print(f"{book.parsec_id}: best bid {book.bids[0].price if book.bids else 'N/A'}")

async def main():
    await ws.connect()
    ws.subscribe(parsec_id="polymarket:0x...", outcome="Yes")
    await ws.run_forever()

asyncio.run(main())
```
