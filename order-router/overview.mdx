## How it works

The order router is a unified interface for placing, managing, and tracking
orders across every supported exchange. You specify the exchange as a query
parameter — Parsec handles authentication, signing, and protocol differences.

## Authentication modes

| Mode | How credentials work | Best for |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| Stored (Mode A) | `PUT /credentials` once, trade forever | Most users |
| Managed wallet | `POST /wallet` + `POST /link`, we handle keys | UI traders |
| Per-request (Mode B) | Pass creds per-request via header/body | Pro traders, builders |

## Order lifecycle

```
1. POST   /orders?exchange=X     → Create order (returns Order with status)
2. GET    /orders?exchange=X     → List open orders
3. GET    /orders/:id?exchange=X → Poll order status
4. DELETE /orders/:id?exchange=X → Cancel order
```

## Order types

| Type | Behavior | Supported |
|------|----------|-----------|
| `gtc` | Good-til-cancelled (default) | All exchanges |
| `ioc` | Immediate-or-cancel | Polymarket, Kalshi |
| `fok` | Fill-or-kill | Polymarket |

Set via `params.order_type` in the create order request body. Unsupported combinations return `501`.

## Supported exchanges

| Exchange | Create | Cancel | Positions | Balance | Orderbook | Price History |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Polymarket | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Kalshi | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Limitless | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Opinion | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Predict.fun | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

Use `GET /exchanges` to see the full capability matrix at runtime.

## Pre-trade checks

Before placing an order, you can use these endpoints to assess liquidity and readiness:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /execution-price` | Estimate VWAP + slippage for a hypothetical order |
| `GET /orderbook` | Inspect the live orderbook |
| `GET /approvals` | Check Polymarket token approvals (managed wallets) |
| `GET /ping` | Verify exchange connectivity and auth status |
